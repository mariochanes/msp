Thank you for taking a moment to visit our site

Like many cities across America ,Portland has a challenge in caring for the homeless. We all have a vision in our minds when we think of the homeless. Many people are for the homeless in spirit and that is good. After being with and listening to many homeless folks I now see them as urban nomads with unique needs. Nomads have no permanent abode. Nomads travel from place to place. Every continent and every culture has had or has proud ,resilient ,nomadic people. Certainly, housing is an important need for the homeless but I am not able to meet that challenge; not right now. By providing and hand delivering hot meals ,with quality caloric value per dollar spent is one of our goals. Our second goal is listening, while sitting with or walking with each person we meet. Each have a special story to tell, about how they feel, what they hope for and what can make a positive difference in their lives. Yes, hot nourishing meals , placed in their hands while being with them nourishes their bodies and souls. It opens the door to understanding...being with. As an example, many women tell me a tent would make their lives safer,(a small tent !) A refurbished ... $10.00...(new in their minds) bicycle can and does make a big difference. Wool blankets ,gloves, socks, long underwear, bungee cords, , tarps ,foam/ground cloths even a small piece of carpet to sit upon while resting or eating or to stand on while dressing can make a big difference.

“There is a meaning in every journey that is unknown to the traveler.”

Can you help us help them in some small way in this journey ?
